HOW-TO-RUN:

	Alright, so if you don't have "CMake" for the terminal/command line, 
	you need to download it now. The CalPoly machines should already
	have this set up. Check in terminal to see if it is there!

	Type "cmake ." in the terminal and hit enter.
		(This builds us our own make file!)

	Next, as per usual, type "make" and it will compile the program 
	into an executable.

	For now, run ./lab1 (this will be changed in a bit). 


WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE CMAKE

	You will have to run cmake command everytime you add a source file (you 
	do not have to run it if you are only changing the file).

	To make sure cmake recognizes the files, you will have to append your 
	source file name into the "sources.txt" file. Make sure you place 
	both .h and .cpp files if you have a header file. 

	Once you finished adding files to sources.txt and source directory,
	you can run cmake. 

	IMPORTANT: Place our files in the source directory.
